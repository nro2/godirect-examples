# Using Python with Go DirectÂ® Devices

If you are new to Python, you may want to visit our [Getting started with Go Direct and Python page](./godirect-py-getting-started.md) or our [Go Direct FAQ page](./godirect-py-faqs.md) for some tips and troubleshooting ideas.

The examples in this folder will walk you through some of the basics of talking to a Go Direct device using Python. Under the hood, they all use the [godirect module](https://pypi.org/project/godirect/) to communicate with the Go Direct devices. However, to make things a bit simpler, we created a layer to abstract some of the details away and provide cleaner paths to the most common functions. That layer is named `gdx` and can be found in the [/gdx/](./gdx) folder. All of the examples in this folder make use of it for a cleaner, simpler entry point into coding with Go Direct devices.

For other ideas and more advanced examples, take a look in the [/advanced_examples/](./advanced_examples) folder.

## Example 1: User Prompts and Collecting Data

The [gdx_getting_started_1.py](https://github.com/VernierST/godirect-examples/blob/master/python/gdx_getting_started_1.py) example shows you how to use the gdx functions to:
- Connect to a Go Direct device through a USB cable
- Provide the user with a prompt to select the active sensors
- Provide the user with a prompt to set the measurement period
- Collect a few measurements from the enabled sensors

## Example 2: Setting Defaults and Passing Arguments

The [gdx_getting_started_2.py](https://github.com/VernierST/godirect-examples/blob/master/python/gdx_getting_started_2.py) example shows you how to avoid using prompts (and instead pass arguments) to select the active sensors and set the measurement period:
- Connect to a Go Direct device through a USB cable
- Set the active sensors in your program
- Set the measurement period in your program
- Collect a few measurements from the enabled sensors

## Example 3: Showing Sensor Information

The [gdx_getting_started_3.py](https://github.com/VernierST/godirect-examples/blob/master/python/gdx_getting_started_3.py) example shows how you can use the gdx functions to list information on all of the sensor channels on a Go Direct device. This includes sensor channel number, sensor description, units, and "incompatible sensors".
- Connect to a Go Direct device through a USB cable
- Obtain and show sensor information

## Example 4: Communicating with Go Direct Sensor via Bluetooth

The [gdx_getting_started_4.py](https://github.com/VernierST/godirect-examples/blob/master/python/gdx_getting_started_4.py) example uses a Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) connection and demonstrates how you can use the gdx functions to:
- Find and connect to a Go Direct device over BLE
- Obtain some device information, like battery level, charger state, and RSSI (radio signal strength)
- Set the active sensors and collection rate
- Collect a few measurements from the enabled sensors

## Example 5: Export Sensor Data as CSV

The [gdx_getting_started_5.py](https://github.com/VernierST/godirect-examples/blob/master/python/gdx_getting_started_5.py) example provides some ideas about what you can do with sensor data by using the built-in csv Python module. It shows you how to:
- Connect to a Go Direct device through a USB cable
- Set the active sensors and collection rate
- Collect a few measurements from the enabled sensors
- Output the data as a comma-separated-value file

## Example 6: Collect Data at High Speeds with Multiple Channels

The [gdx_getting_started_6.py](https://github.com/VernierST/godirect-examples/blob/master/python/gdx_getting_started_6.py) example shows how to collect data at high speeds with multiple sensors, using a list of lists.

- Connect to a Go Direct device through a USB cable or BLE
- Set the active sensors and collection rate
- Collect a few measurements from the enabled sensors
